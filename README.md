# Simple Room Rental Contract
Simple example smart contract for renting a room. Mainly wrote this to get familiar with solidity and using the Remix IDE. 

Contract has someone who owns the room, a room for rent, and a function to rent the room. I tried to play around with some modifiers to make sure only the owner can call certain functions and the appropriate ammount is paid for a rental.
